A method is a re-usable section of code. It is important to code this way (rather than as one block of continuous code) because:

(a) if you code this way you can track bugs more easily;
(b) if you code this way you can easily re-use code within the same programme or in others;
(c) you can use methods a lot when using objects

See methods

def prime(n)
  puts "That's not an integer." unless n.is_a? Integer
  is_prime = true
  for i in 2..n-1
    if n % i == 0
      is_prime = false
    end
  end
  if is_prime
    puts "#{n} is prime!"
  else
    puts "#{n} is not prime."
  end
end

prime(2)
prime(9)
prime(11)
prime(51)
prime(97)

Output: 

2 is prime!
9 is not prime.
11 is prime!
51 is not prime.
97 is prime!


Method Syntax

Methods have three parts:

(a) The header

    The header includes;
	(i) the 'def' keyword (meaning define);
	(ii)  the name you are assigning to the method;
	(iii)  any arguments the method takes.

(b) The body

	(i) the body is the code block that describes the procedure the methods carries out;
	(ii) the body is indented by two spaces by convention;
	method ends with the 'end' keyword. 

(c) The 'end'
